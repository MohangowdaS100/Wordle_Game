# Wordle - Terminal Game in C

This project is a text-based version of the popular Wordle game, implemented in the C programming language.

## What is Wordle?

Wordle is a word guessing game where the objective is to guess a hidden 5-letter word within 6 attempts. It's a game of logic, vocabulary, and deduction.

## Game Rules

1. **Guess the Word**:  
   You have to guess a 5-letter English word.

2. **Feedback After Each Guess**:  
   After each guess, the game provides feedback for every letter in your word:
   - 🟩 **Green**: The letter is in the correct position.
   - 🟨 **Yellow**: The letter exists in the word but is in the wrong position.
   - 🟥 **Red**: The letter is not in the word at all.

3. **Win or Lose**:
   - You win if you guess the word correctly within 6 tries.
   - If you run out of tries, the correct word is revealed.

## Example

Let's say the target word is `PLANT` and the player guesses `PARTY`:


This means:
- 'P' is correct and in the correct position (🟩)
- 'A' is in the word but in the wrong position (🟨)
- 'R', 'T', and 'Y' are not in the word (🟥)

## Game Objectives

- Encourage logical thinking and pattern recognition.
- Improve vocabulary and spelling.
- Fun and challenging brain exercise.

## Customization

- You can modify the word list (`wordl.txt`) to change the difficulty or language.
- The number of attempts and word length can be adjusted in the code for variations.
